                    The principle of Alignment explains that each element of the page must be in line with another 
                    element of the page, which makes us think about where to place each element and not leave its placement
                    to chance.<br />
                    On the Church page you can see that all the elements are perfectly aligned, this is even better seen
                    when viewed on a wide screen. there you will see each image and other elements the perfect order and alignment.

                    The repetition indicates that we must use or repeat certain elements so that our designs have a pattern.
                    <br />
                    "Mercado Livre" on its site always uses the same colors, yellow, white and a little blue, and the same fonts;
                     which gives uniformity and a corporate look to your website.

                <h2 class="subtitulo">White Space and Clean Design</h2>
                <p>Google<br />
                    <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">www.google.com</a>

                    White space is very important for the eyes to rest, to separate elements and improve the structure of a design.
                    And a clean design is very important so that it is easy to locate an element or so that it is more easily understood what the site does.
                    <br />
                    I have always thought that the best example is google, there are few elements, good white space, super clean design and anyone understands
                    what the site does or what it is for.
